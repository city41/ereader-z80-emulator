# System Backgrounds

The pngs in this directory are a recreation of the system backgrounds normally found on the EReader ROM.

They goal is to create new backgrounds that invoke and are similar to the official ones, but don't infringe on copyright.

Each png is named after the bg's id.

These get built and packaged into the final node module as data urls, see `scripts/bundleSystemBackgrounds.ts`
