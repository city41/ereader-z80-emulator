# E-Reader Z80 Emulator

This is a web based emulator written in JavaScript and TypeScript for the Nintendo E-Reader.

It allows running E-Reader applications without using any of Nintendo's proprietary IP. The application runs completely outside of a GBA and an E-Reader, so there are no copyright or IP implications.

## Status: Pre Alpha

This is very raw and was just started at time of writing this.
